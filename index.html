<div class="quotes">
    <p>In life  there is no absolute truth and no absolute reality.A good number of times we engage in discussions unaware of the <br> standing of the people we are actively engaging.
    It is wise to always  know that life has so many grey areas and this is a <br> big reason why compromise should be exercised.<br>Maintaining composure is also a challenge in a  fast paced world where everyone seems irritable and irrational.<br>May peace find you as you move through life.Happiness will never knock on your door and happiness is not a journey.<br>Happiness is cultivated by looking for happiness.so my dear friends enjoy the process of getting to where you want <br> and life will always be pleasant . Stress is self inflicted.Have you ever asked yourself why people who live like 'birds' <br> dont have the same stress you have yet they have so little compared to you.
